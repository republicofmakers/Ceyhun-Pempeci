# Who am I?

My name is Ceyhun Pempeci, and I was born in Turkey in 1997. I spent most of my early life in a small village near Ankara, where I grew up before moving to the city center for high school. I spent four years there completing my secondary education.

I'm proud to say that I funded nearly all of my education through scholarships, which reflects both my determination and academic performance.

My greatest passion is electronicsâ€”both as a hobby and a profession. I also have a strong interest in martial arts, and enjoy 3D printing as a creative outlet and technical challenge.

### Thesis
Graduation Thesis: **Angle of Arrival Estimation Algorithms Using Received Signal Strength Indicator**  <br>
In my thesis, I explored ways to improve indoor positioning systems using low-cost ESP32 module and directional antennas. My research involved designing an antenna multiplexer with Pi and L-type impedance matching circuits, where the impedance values were determined using a network analyzer and smith chart to achieve better performance. I also implemented trigonometric algorithms for Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation in C code, focusing on accurate and efficient signal processing. This work showed the potential of RSSI-based algorithms for reliable AoA estimation, offering a scalable and affordable approach for outdoor positioning with applications in areas like logistics, healthcare, and smart infrastructure.

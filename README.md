# Who am I?

Hi, my name is Ceyhun Pempeci.

I was born in Turkey in 1997 and spent most of my early life in a small village near Ankara. Later, I moved to the city center to attend high school, where I completed four years of secondary education.

I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Electronics Engineering from Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (HUFS) in South Korea. Studying abroad not only strengthened my technical foundation but also broadened my global perspective and adaptability.

I'm proud to have funded nearly all of my education through scholarships—a reflection of both my dedication and academic performance.

My greatest passion is electronics, which I pursue both professionally and as a hobby. I'm also deeply interested in martial arts, and I enjoy 3D printing as a creative and technical challenge.

### Thesis / Graduation Project
Graduation Thesis: **Angle of Arrival Estimation Algorithms Using Received Signal Strength Indicator**  <br>
In my thesis, I explored ways to improve indoor positioning systems using low-cost ESP32 module and directional antennas. My research involved designing an antenna multiplexer with Pi and L-type impedance matching circuits, where the impedance values were determined using a network analyzer and smith chart to achieve better performance. I also implemented trigonometric algorithms for Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation in C code, focusing on accurate and efficient signal processing. This work showed the potential of RSSI-based algorithms for reliable AoA estimation, offering a scalable and affordable approach for outdoor positioning with applications in areas like logistics, healthcare, and smart infrastructure.

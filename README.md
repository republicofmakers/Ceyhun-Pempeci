# Who am I?


My name is "Ceyhun Pempeci"... My repo called "Republic of Makers".

The name 'Republic of Makers' reflects my belief in the importance of fostering a culture of creation over consumption. In a world increasingly focused on consumption, I hope to inspire a future where creators outnumber consumers, contributing to innovation and shared knowledge.

I am specialized in Embedded Systems. This repository serves as a platform to showcase my skills, education and professional journey. I will be also sharing open source projects to contribute to and inspire the community.

### Thesis
Graduation Thesis: **Angle of Arrival Estimation Algorithms Using Received Signal Strength Indicator**  <br>
In my thesis, I explored ways to improve indoor positioning systems using low-cost ESP32 module and directional antennas. My research involved designing an antenna multiplexer with Pi and L-type impedance matching circuits, where the impedance values were determined using a network analyzer and smith chart to achieve better performance. I also implemented trigonometric algorithms for Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation in C code, focusing on accurate and efficient signal processing. This work showed the potential of RSSI-based algorithms for reliable AoA estimation, offering a scalable and affordable approach for outdoor positioning with applications in areas like logistics, healthcare, and smart infrastructure.

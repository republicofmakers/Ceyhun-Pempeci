# Who am I?


My name is "Ceyhun Pempeci"... My repo called "Republic of Makers".

The name 'Republic of Makers' reflects my belief in the importance of fostering a culture of creation over consumption. In a world increasingly focused on consumption, I hope to inspire a future where creators outnumber consumers, contributing to innovation and shared knowledge.

I am specialized in Embedded Systems. This repository serves as a platform to showcase my skills, education and professional journey. I will be also sharing open source projects to contribute to and inspire the community.

### Thesis
Graduation Thesis: **Angle of Arrival Estimation Algorithms Using Received Signal Strength Indicator**  <br>
In my thesis, I explored ways to improve indoor positioning systems using low-cost ESP32 module and directional antennas. My research involved designing an antenna multiplexer with Pi and L-type impedance matching circuits, where the impedance values were determined using a network analyzer and smith chart to achieve better performance. I also implemented trigonometric algorithms for Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation in C code, focusing on accurate and efficient signal processing. This work showed the potential of RSSI-based algorithms for reliable AoA estimation, offering a scalable and affordable approach for outdoor positioning with applications in areas like logistics, healthcare, and smart infrastructure.

| **Sports**      |  I'm passionate about martial arts, particularly archery and swordsmanship. From 2016 to 2021, I was an active member of my university's Korean Martial Arts Student Club. It was a rewarding experience that combined discipline, fun, and the opportunity to improve both skills and overall health. I also practice swordsmanship whenever I have free time.     | [Click](https://github.com/republicofmakers/Sports)| 2016 - now |
| **3D Printing** |  I've been involved in 3D printing since 2018, starting with the release of the Ender 3 Pro. Nowadays, I use the Bambu Lab X1 Combo for my projects, ranging from creating custom cases for electronics to replicating or repairing broken mechanical parts. | [Click](https://github.com/republicofmakers/3D-Printing/tree/main)| 2018 - now |
